OVERVIEW
----------------
It's simple rust SDL2 snake game. May be this code is ugly and ineffective, but it's my first project in Rust.
I believe my skills in Rust will grow up over time)

COMPILE AND RUN
----------------

Require SDL dependencies.
There are dll's in `deps` folder.
Need to move it to PATH or .exe folder.

There are some SDL lib file require to compile.
You can find it here: https://www.libsdl.org/, https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/

WHAT'S NEXT
----------------

+ - -> For runtime change height and width of playing area (Now 25x25, and you can change it before compile).

Tests coverage? But i don't understand now how i can realize unit tests for rendering textures.
